Price scale
Version: 5.0
Price scale
Price Scale (or price axis) is a vertical scale that mostly maps prices to coordinates and vice versa. The rules of converting depend on a price scale mode, a height of the chart and visible part of the data.

Price scales

By default, chart has 2 predefined price scales: left and right, and an unlimited number of overlay scales.

Only left and right price scales could be displayed on the chart, all overlay scales are hidden.

If you want to change left price scale, you need to use leftPriceScale option, to change right price scale use rightPriceScale, to change default options for an overlay price scale use overlayPriceScales option.

Alternatively, you can use IChartApi.priceScale method to get an API object of any price scale or ISeriesApi.priceScale to get an API object of series' price scale (the price scale that the series is attached to).

Creating a price scale
By default a chart has only 2 price scales: left and right.

If you want to create an overlay price scale, you can simply assign priceScaleId option to a series (note that a value should be differ from left and right) and a chart will automatically create an overlay price scale with provided ID. If a price scale with such ID already exists then a series will be attached to this existing price scale. Further you can use provided price scale ID to get its corresponding API object via IChartApi.priceScale method.

Removing a price scale
The default price scales (left and right) cannot be removed, you can only hide them by setting visible option to false.

An overlay price scale exists while there is at least 1 series attached to this price scale. Thus, to remove an overlay price scale remove all series attached to this price scale.
