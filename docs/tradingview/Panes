Panes
Version: 5.0
Panes
Panes are essential elements that help segregate data visually within a single chart. Panes are useful when you have a chart that needs to show more than one kind of data. For example, you might want to see a stock's price over time in one pane and its trading volume in another. This setup helps users get a fuller picture without cluttering the chart.

By default, Lightweight Charts™ has a single pane, however, you can add more panes to the chart to display different series in separate areas. For detailed examples and code snippets on how to implement panes in your charts see tutorial.

Customization Options
Lightweight Charts™ offers a few customization options to tailor the appearance and behavior of panes:

Pane Separator Color: Customize the color of the pane separators to match the chart design or improve visibility.

Separator Hover Color: Enhance user interaction by changing the color of separators on mouse hover.

Resizable Panes: Opt to enable or disable the resizing of panes by the user, offering flexibility in how data is displayed.

Managing Panes
While the specific methods to manipulate panes are covered in the detailed example, it's important to note that Lightweight Charts™ provides an API for pane management. This includes adding new panes, moving series between panes, adjusting pane height, and removing panes. The API ensures that developers have full control over the pane lifecycle and organization within their charts.



Lightweight Charts™ allows you to create multiple panes in a single chart.

Using multiple panes in a charting library can be incredibly useful for a variety of analytical and visualization scenarios, especially when dealing with complex datasets or requiring detailed comparative analysis across different data dimensions.

This example shows how to use panes in Lightweight Charts™. We will create a chart with two panes: the first one will display a stock's price over time and the second one will contain trading volume. The price and volume will be represented with candles and an area, respectively.

You can see a full working example below.

How to add a pane
To introduce an additional pane into a chart, specify paneIndex during series creation.

Alternatively, you can invoke the moveToPane method on the series instance. Note that if the pane with specified index doesn't exist, it will be created.

const volumeSeries = chart.addSeries(
    HistogramSeries,
    {
        priceFormat: {
            type: 'volume',
        },
    },
    1 // Pane index
);
// Moving the series to a different pane
volumeSeries.moveToPane(2);

If a series is moved out of a pane and no other series remain, the pane will be automatically removed.

Customizations
Lightweight Charts™ provides options to customize the panes. You can adjust the pane separator color by specifying the separatorColor property in the layout.panes chart options, and use separatorHoverColor to change the separator color on hover.

chart.applyOptions({
    layout: {
        panes: {
            separatorColor: '#ff0000',
            separatorHoverColor: '#00ff00',
            enableResize: false,
        },
    },
});

Lightweight Charts™ includes PaneApi that allows you to control each pane. The API has methods to get information on the pane such as getHeight(), paneIndex(), and getSeries(). It also contains methods to adjust the pane parameters, for example setHeight(height) and moveTo(paneIndex).

To get a PaneApi instance for each pane, you need to call the panes method on the ChartApi instance. Let's say we want to set the height of the second pane to 300px and move it to the first position.

const secondPane = chart.panes()[1];
secondPane.setHeight(300);
secondPane.moveTo(0);

Note that the minimum pane height is 30px. Any values lower than 30px will be ignored.

To remove the pane, you can call the removePane(paneIndex) method on the ChartApi instance.

chart.removePane(1);

Note that removing a pane also removes any series contained within it.

const chartOptions = {
    layout: {
        textColor: 'black',
        background: { type: 'solid', color: 'white' },
        panes: {
            separatorColor: '#f22c3d',
            separatorHoverColor: 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1)',
            // setting this to false will disable the resize of the panes by the user
            enableResize: false,
        },
    },
};
const chart = createChart(document.getElementById('container'), chartOptions);

const areaSeries = chart.addSeries(AreaSeries, {
    topColor: '#2962FF',
    bottomColor: 'rgba(41, 98, 255, 0.28)',
    lineColor: '#2962FF',
    lineWidth: 2,
});

const candlestickSeries = chart.addSeries(CandlestickSeries, {
    upColor: '#26a69a', downColor: '#ef5350', borderVisible: false,
    wickUpColor: '#26a69a', wickDownColor: '#ef5350',
    // we are setting pane index 1 for this series
}, 1);

areaSeries.setData([
    { time: '2018-10-19', value: 52.89 },
]);

// setting the data for the volume series.
// note: we are defining each bars color as part of the data
candlestickSeries.setData([
    { time: '2018-10-19', open: 75.16, high: 82.84, low: 36.16, close: 45.72 },
]);
const candlesPane = chart.panes()[1];
candlesPane.moveTo(0);
candlesPane.setHeight(150);
chart.timeScale().fitContent();
